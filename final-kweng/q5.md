# 5.

## a.
The already running shell first forks to create another shell-- the child process. Memory is allocated for the child process, and the parent's address space is copied over to the child's.
## b.
When the kernel switches to running the child process, the process will first load prog into its process memory (via an exec function).
## c.
The pointer p is stored on the stack because it is not malloc'd. printf calls a system call (specifically, write) to ask the kernel to print (the kernel then has to talk to the computer's hardware to actually execute this print). However, we won't actually get this far.

During this time, you can expect context switches as the timer goes off, letting the kernel know that it's time to switch to running another process.
## d.
At runtime, the CPU attempts to dereference p-- a null pointer-- leading to the exception. The CPU then returns to the kernel and "asks it what to do". The kernel then sends a signal (in this case, SIGSEGV) to the process.
## e.
The exit system call (which is implicitly in all C programs) is called, letting the kernel know that the child process is done and it's time to terminate it. The child process's memory is freed. The kernel then switches back to running the parent shell process, which has been waiting for the termination of the child process during this entire time. (The kernel also tells the parent process that a segfault caused the child to terminate.)
