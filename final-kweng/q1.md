## a.
Never. While "init", which parents all other processes, is started by the kernel, it is not a process; instead, it tells the CPU which process to switch to and when to switch.
## b.
Always. In a perfect world, fast memory would be so cheap that CPUs would have massive registers (and thus wouldn't need the caches or RAM), so the memory hierarchy would reduce to just the register and the disk (for nonvolatile storage).
## c.
Sometimes. You would immediately exec after fork if you want to spawn a child process and immediately get it running; however, you can call fork without immediately calling exec afterwards.
## d.
Always. VM allows user space programs to access their own "portion" of the overall server's memory without having to worry about running into conflicts with other programs.
## e.
Sometimes. In the Meltdown project, after our custom SIGSEGV handler finished running, we returned to our normal code (which was determined by where we placed the assembly label); without a custom segfault handler, however, the program would then normally terminate.
