# 9.
The first output is the dereferenced header of p1. In malloc, the header of each block was a size_t, which preceded the actual payload and was 8 bytes in size. Thus, it makes sense that we have to subtract 8 from p1 to get to p1's header. We can use p1's header to find the size of p1's payload and whether or not that payload is allocated. 

In this case, 49 & ~0x1 = 48 tells us that the size of p1's payload is 48 bytes, which makes sense because in malloc, we had to align the payloads to 16-byte boundaries (rounding up 40 to an incremenent of 16 leads us to 48). 49 & 0x1 = 1 tells us that p1 has been allocated.

The second output is junk. This is because after being freed, the blocks pointed to by p1 and p2 were most likely coalesced together into a bigger block. Thus, p2 now points to the middle of the payload of this bigger block, which is unallocated. Thus, we can't make any guarantees on what it contains.
