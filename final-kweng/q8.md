When time_read(&pages[0]) and time_read(&pages[1]) are called, the resulting force reads means that the zeroth and first pages are now stored in the CPU's cache. We know that since it took the zeroth and first pages similarly long to be read, they do not point to the same thing. Since it took much less time to read the second and third pages, that implies that that those are already stored in cache, probably because they are identical to either the zeroth or first page.
