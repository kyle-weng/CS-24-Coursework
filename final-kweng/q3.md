nums is stored on the stack because it isn't malloc'ed (in which case, it'd be on the heap). Thus, after get_nums_to_10 finishes, nums will be freed (variables on the stack are automatically freed once the function that created them finishes). Thus, nums (in main) will point to NULL, which will definitely cause a segfault when the program attemps to print nums[2].
