# 2.
(Noticed that name of this question is an anagram for "race condition". Also, this was from lecture. Nice.)
Yes, there is a race condition:

| Thread 1                       | Thread 2                       |
| -------------------------------| -------------------------------|
| while (!stack_is_empty(stack)) |                                | The stack contains 1, 2, and 3.
|                                | while (!stack_is_empty(stack)) |
|                                | pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)      |
|                                | count += stack_pop(stack)      |
|                                | pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock)    |
|                                | while (!stack_is_empty(stack)) | The stack contains 1 and 2.
|                                | pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)      |
|                                | count += stack_pop(stack)      | 
|                                | pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock)    |
|                                | while (!stack_is_empty(stack)) | The stack contains 1.
|                                | pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)      |
|                                | count += stack_pop(stack)      |
|                                | pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock)    | Now, the stack is empty.
| pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)      |                                |
| count += stack_pop(stack)      |                                | Yikes.

Thread 1 calling stack_pop() once leads to undefined behavior if the stack is empty because the stack is already assumed to be not empty (because the same thread checked stack_is_empty() earlier). The threads are racing to pop the last element from the stack.
